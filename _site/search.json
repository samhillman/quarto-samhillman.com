    "text": "I’m currently focused on how changes in resource distribution affects how animals interact, and how this changes their behaviour and disease transmission. I use a mixture of long-term field experiments, lab studies, biologging + social network analysis, and statistical and mathematical modelling.\nThat may sound like a mouthful but I’m an ecologist at heart, passionate about all things natural. As well as ecology I’m interested in teaching and using statistical modelling in R as well as trying to work out how we can apply modern open-science practices to ecological research.\nFind out more about me and my work below or get in touch!"
